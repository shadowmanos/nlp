#### NLP cookbook for Java developers

I have gathered here some practical examples of [Natural Language
Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing),
using Java libraries like
[Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).

The code and any accompanying documentation is written from a developer's
rather than a PhD student's perspective.
That reflects my personal experience from when I started doing NLP at work
and I could find plenty of scientific papers but few code snippets.

All text samples used for testing are Star Trek quotes
(English not Klingon). After an entirely unscientific thought process,
I decided the quotes are grammatically correct, adequately diverse and
of average complexity.
