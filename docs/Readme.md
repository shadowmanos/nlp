# NLP cookbook for Java developers

### Introduction

I have gathered here some practical examples of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing),
using Java libraries like [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).

The code and any accompanying documentation is written from a developer's
rather than a PhD student's perspective. That reflects my personal experience from when
I started doing NLP at work and I could find plenty of scientific papers but few code snippets.

All text samples used for testing are Star Trek quotes
(English not Klingon) sourced from either [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) or
[Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Main).
After an entirely unscientific thought process, I decided such quotes are grammatically correct,
adequately diverse and of average complexity.
