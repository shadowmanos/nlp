title: NLP cookbook for Java developers

### Introduction

I have gathered here some practical examples of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing),
using Java libraries like [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).

The code and accompanying blog posts are written from a developer's
rather than a PhD student's perspective. That reflects my personal experience from when
I started doing NLP at work. I could find plenty of scientific papers but few code snippets.
Occasional references to linguistics or grammar will be in code monkey's terms.

All text samples used for testing are Star Trek quotes
(English not Klingon) sourced from either [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) or
[Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Main).
After an entirely unscientific thought process, I decided such quotes are grammatically correct,
adequately diverse and of average complexity.
